# jQuery-Trim-Multiselect


## The idea 

A micro jQuery plugin, trimming long strings in multiselect elements. The problem it solves is very specific, but I recently had to deal with it and this is a working way to deal with it withought going for a full select / multiselect replacement plugin like [Chosen](http://harvesthq.github.io/chosen/) for example.

## The reason

Although this plugin has very limited use case it is also a learning experience for me. So any help, criticism and feedback in general is most welcome.

## The progress

I added several issues and a milestone to track what I want to cover for an initial release. Hope to clear those in a couple of weeks from now. The main issue with all tasks referenced: #1
